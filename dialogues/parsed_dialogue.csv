"Hey therabot, I’m kinda in a predicament","Hey, what’s going on?"
"Well, my wife is expecting soon which im really excited about but shes been pestering me about my smoking habits because of it","Congratulations, that is exciting! What is she saying to you about your smoking habits?"
"She just is worried that im not gona be as focused on the baby cuz ill just be busy smoking, cuz i not gonna be around the baby when im smoking and gets upset at me everytime",respect your consideration for your baby by not smoking around them. How does what your wife say make you feel?
i think its not true and that i can be a great dad and still hit the jay its not like i do it everyday,I see. What do you think makes her believe that your parenting abilities will be affected by your smoking habits?
"I mean i think its just that she wants me to be there every second with the baby, which i definitely will be, especially the first few months, but i dont see why I can’t just go with my brahs and have a sesh once in a while, shes trynna get me to stop completely for good","So from my understanding, she wants you to completely stop but you would like to do it every now and then?"
"Yea pretty much, and its honestly making things worse, i feel like now im smoking so much wtih my boys cuz i wanna take advantage of the time i have",It’s commendable that you will cut down on your habits once your baby is born. It seems that you are pretty concerned about raising your child in a good way. Is that true?
"Yea im deadass so excited for him, he’s gonna be a little me. I would do anything for him im sure but like my wife’s point of saying to stop smoking makes no sense.",That is very sweet. Why does what your wife say not make sense to you?
"cuz like yea if im smoking around lil tony then yea thats bad for his lungs and brain and whatever but this is how i envision it. I can have all my boys over, some of them have babies too and we have a nice get together and we all hang out with the babies. And then lets say the babies all are inside napping or something, we just go out and cheef up a like old times. How does that hurt the baby? Also the ones who have babies still smoke and their wives dont give a shit",I understand where you are coming from. Have you tried to explain this to her?
yea i try telling her this all the time like i dont see how she can argue it makes perfect sense,How has she responded?
"she gets upset and says that im not getting the point, she usually says that I need to grow up or that its bad for my health",Have you considered that maybe she wants you to quit smoking for reasons beyond your new baby?
"Yea its definitely more then just that but like none of those are important idk why tf it matters, like my health will be fine ive been smoking since I was 15 and im fine, plus if i die like a few years earlier then i should have cuz of the weed i dont give af, at least i was able to enjoy myself",Your wife definitely seems to care a lot about you and want the best for you. Have you considered that maybe the way she feels about you smoking is just like how you feel about smoking around your newborn?
"I mean sure she loves me and I love her endlessly a lot, but i just feel like this is where we disagree. Plus if i stop smoking what will my freinds say, whenver we socialize thats our main thing, just smoke a j, kick back, and chill. I cant hang out around my friends if theyre smoking and I’m not thats too hard",I understand. Do you think the hardest part about quitting for you is the social aspect? Do you think you will miss out on socializing?
"yea thats lowkey it, like my friends will just continue to hangout and smoke without me and then eventually we’ll drift apart and then ill lose them.",Do you ever hangout with your friends without smoking?
"Yea I’d say so, like we occasionally on a work night we watch football and have a beer or something.","That’s good to hear! It sounds like you and your friends already have other ways to bond besides smoking. Do you think you could start incorporating more of those non-smoking activities so that if you cut down, it won’t feel like you’re missing out?"
"I mean, I guess we could do that more often, but smoking is just what we do the most.","That makes sense, it’s familiar and comfortable. But it still sounds like you’re worried that if you stop, your friendships might change. Is that right?"
"Yea, exactly. Like what if I stop and they don’t invite me anymore? I don’t wanna be left out.","That’s a real concern. But strong friendships aren’t just about smoking together, they’re about the connection you have. If they’re really your boys, they’ll still want to kick it with you no matter what. Have you talked to any of them about how you’re feeling?"
"Nah, not really. I don’t wanna make it a big deal or let them know I’m sorta beefing with my wife yk","That’s fair, but it might help to bring it up casually. You don’t have to say you’re quitting forever, just that you’re thinking of cutting back because of the baby. See how they respond. You might be surprised."
"Maybe. I feel like some of them would get it, but others might not.","That’s possible, and it’s okay. Not everyone will understand, but I'm sure they will respect your decision because they are your friends. And you’ll still have other ways to connect, like watching football."
"Yea, I guess I could try to ease into it.","That’s a great approach. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. You can start by slowly cutting back when you're around your friends, and you might find new ways to enjoy time with them. Relationships don’t end overnight."
"Aight, I’ll think about it.","Awesome, let me know if you need anymore help."
